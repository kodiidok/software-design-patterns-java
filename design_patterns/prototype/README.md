# Prototype Pattern

The Prototype design pattern is a creational pattern that allows the creation of new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. It involves creating a prototype interface or class, and concrete classes that implement the cloning operation.

**Prototype:**
- The Prototype interface declares a method for cloning itself.
- It is the common interface for all concrete prototypes.

**Concrete Prototype:**
- The Concrete Prototype implements the cloning method declared in the Prototype interface.
- It represents the object that can be cloned.

**Client:**
- The Client is responsible for creating new objects by cloning existing prototypes.
- It interacts with the prototypes without being aware of their specific classes.

### Usage:

**Client Code:**
- The client creates new objects by cloning existing prototypes.
- It can use different prototypes to create objects with different initial states.

### When to Use the Prototype Pattern:

- When the cost of creating an object is more expensive than copying an existing one.
- When you want to create new objects with different initial states by copying prototypes.
- When the system should remain independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

### Benefits:

- Reduces the cost of creating new objects by copying existing ones.
- Allows the creation of new objects with different initial states without subclassing.
- Promotes flexibility by allowing the client to use different prototypes.

### Considerations:

- Ensure that the cloned objects are independent of each other, especially for mutable objects.
- Pay attention to the performance implications, especially if deep cloning is required.

The Prototype pattern is particularly useful when you need to create new objects that share similarities with existing objects and want to avoid the overhead of creating them from scratch.
