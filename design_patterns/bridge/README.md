# Bridge Pattern

The Bridge design pattern is a structural pattern that separates the abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. It involves creating a bridge interface that contains the abstraction, and concrete implementations for both the abstraction and its components.

**Abstraction:**
- The Abstraction is the high-level interface in the bridge pattern.
- It contains a reference to the Implementor and delegates the implementation details to it.
- Abstraction provides a more abstract layer that can have different implementations.

**Implementor:**
- The Implementor is the interface for the implementation classes.
- It declares the methods that the Abstraction uses to delegate the work to the concrete implementations.
- Implementor is not aware of the Abstraction.

**Refined Abstraction:**
- The Refined Abstraction is an extension of the Abstraction.
- It can add additional features or modifications without affecting the Implementor.

**Concrete Implementor:**
- The Concrete Implementor is the concrete implementation of the Implementor interface.
- It provides specific functionality required by the Abstraction.

### Usage:

**Client Code:**
- The client interacts with the Abstraction, not directly with the Implementor.
- The client can switch between different implementations of the Abstraction at runtime.

### When to Use the Bridge Pattern:

- When you want to separate abstraction from its implementation and allow them to evolve independently.
- When changes in the implementation should not affect the clients using the abstraction.
- When you have a hierarchy of abstractions and multiple implementations.

### Benefits:

- Decouples abstraction from its implementation, providing flexibility.
- Allows the client to choose different implementations at runtime.
- Facilitates the extension of both abstractions and implementations independently.

### Considerations:

- Introduces an additional level of abstraction, which may increase complexity.
- Requires a clear understanding of when to use the pattern to avoid overengineering.

The Bridge pattern is particularly useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation, allowing for a more flexible and adaptable system architecture.
