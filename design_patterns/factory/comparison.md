| Feature                   | Simple Factory                                                                                | Factory Method                                                                                                                   | Abstract Factory                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Intent**                | Centralizes object creation in a single factory class.                                        | Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.             | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.                                           |
| **Type**                  | Creational                                                                                    | Creational                                                                                                                       | Creational                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Structure**             | Single factory class responsible for creating objects.                                        | Creator interface with a factory method. Subclasses implement the factory method.                                                | Abstract factory interface with multiple factory methods, each responsible for creating a family of related objects. Concrete factories implement the interface. |
| **Client Usage**          | Clients directly use the factory class to create objects.                                     | Clients use the factory method through the Creator interface to create objects.                                                  | Clients use the abstract factory to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.                                                |
| **Extensibility**         | Limited extensibility. Adding new products requires modifying the factory class.              | High extensibility. New products can be added by creating new Creator subclasses.                                                | High extensibility. New families of products can be added by creating new ConcreteFactory implementations.                                                       |
| **Open/Closed Principle** | Violates the Open/Closed Principle. Adding new products requires modifying the factory class. | Follows the Open/Closed Principle. New products can be added by creating new Creator subclasses without modifying existing code. | Follows the Open/Closed Principle. New families of products can be added by creating new ConcreteFactory implementations without modifying existing code.        |
| **Example**               | SimpleFactory.java                                                                            | FactoryMethod.java                                                                                                               | AbstractFactory.java                                                                                                                                             |
| **Usage**                 | `Product product = SimpleFactory.createProduct("A");`                                         | `Creator creator = new ConcreteCreator(); Product product = creator.createProduct();`                                            | `AbstractFactory factory = new ConcreteFactory(); ProductA productA = factory.createProductA(); ProductB productB = factory.createProductB();`                   |
