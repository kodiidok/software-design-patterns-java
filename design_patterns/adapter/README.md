# Adaper Pattern

The Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code. The Adapter pattern involves a single class called the Adapter that is responsible for joining functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.

**Class Adapter:**
- The Adapter extends the target class and implements the interface that the client expects.
- It "adapts" the interface of the adaptee class to the target interface.

**Object Adapter:**
- The Adapter contains an instance of the adaptee class and implements the target interface.
- It delegates the requests to the adaptee's methods.

### Usage:
**Client Code:**
- The client interacts with the Target interface, not directly with the Adaptee.
- The client may be unaware of the existence of the Adapter.

### When to Use the Adapter Pattern:
- When you want to use a class with an incompatible interface.
- When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes.
- When you want to provide a generic interface to a set of classes.

### Benefits:
- Allows the integration of incompatible interfaces.
- Enhances reusability by making existing classes work with others without modifying their code.
- Promotes flexibility and ease of maintenance.

### Considerations:
- Be mindful of potential performance overhead, especially for object adapters.
- Ensure that the Adapter does not introduce unintended side effects.

The Adapter pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to integrate legacy code, third-party libraries, or components with differing interfaces. It facilitates a smooth interaction between components that would otherwise be incompatible.
