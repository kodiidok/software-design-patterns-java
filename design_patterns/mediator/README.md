# Mediator Pattern

The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines an object that centralizes communication between multiple objects, encapsulating their interactions. It promotes loose coupling by ensuring that objects do not communicate directly with each other, but instead, they communicate through a mediator. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a set of objects need to collaborate in a well-organized manner.

**Mediator:**
- The Mediator interface declares methods for communication between different components.
- Concrete Mediator: Implements the Mediator interface, managing the interactions between concrete components.

**Colleague:**
- Colleague classes are the components that communicate through the mediator.
- They are aware of the mediator and use it to communicate with other colleagues.
  
### Usage:

**Client Code:**
- Colleagues interact with the mediator to communicate with each other.
- Colleagues are decoupled from each other, reducing direct dependencies.

### When to Use the Mediator Pattern:

- When a set of objects need to communicate in a well-organized manner.
- When there are many connections between objects, and managing these connections becomes complex.
- When you want to avoid direct connections between objects to promote reusability.

### Benefits:

- Promotes loose coupling between objects by centralizing communication.
- Simplifies object interactions by avoiding direct connections.
- Facilitates the addition of new components without modifying existing ones.

### Considerations:

- Be cautious of creating a mediator that becomes too complex, as it may violate the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Ensure that colleagues do not have direct references to each other to maintain loose coupling.

The Mediator pattern is particularly effective when dealing with systems where the interactions between objects become complex and hard to manage. It fosters a more organized and modular design by centralizing communication through a mediator, leading to increased flexibility and easier maintenance.
