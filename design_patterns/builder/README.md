# Builder Pattern

The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It allows the same construction process to create various representations of an object. The pattern involves the use of a director class, an abstract builder interface, and concrete implementations of the abstract builder.

**Director:**
- The Director is responsible for orchestrating the construction process.
- It receives a builder object from the client and instructs it on how to build the product.
- The director is not aware of the specific product representation.

**Abstract Builder:**
- An Abstract Builder interface declares the methods required to construct a product.
- It typically includes common methods for building different parts of the product.
- Concrete builders implement the abstract builder to provide specific implementations for constructing the product.

**Concrete Builder:**
- A Concrete Builder class implements the abstract builder interface to construct a specific product.
- It keeps track of the product being constructed and provides methods to set its attributes.
- The client interacts with the builder to customize and retrieve the final product.

**Product:**
- The Product is the complex object being constructed.
- It is often composed of multiple parts or components.

### Usage:

**Client Code:**
- The client creates a director object and an abstract builder object.
- The client passes the builder to the director.
- The director constructs the product using the builder, and the client retrieves the final product.

### When to Use the Builder Pattern:

- When the construction of an object is complex and involves multiple steps.
- When you want to create different representations of the same object construction process.
- When you want to ensure that the construction steps are abstracted from the client.

### Benefits:

- Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- Provides a clear and consistent construction process.
- Allows the construction of different representations of a product.
- Introduces an additional layer of abstraction with the use of an abstract builder.

### Considerations:

- The client needs to be aware of the specific builder to use.
- The pattern may result in a more verbose implementation compared to creating an object directly.

The Builder pattern with an abstract builder is particularly useful when you want to define a common interface for multiple concrete builders, ensuring consistency in the construction process while allowing for variations in product representation.
