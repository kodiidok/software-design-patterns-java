# Strategy Pattern

The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose a specific algorithm from a family of algorithms at runtime, making the client independent of the algorithm's implementation.

**Context:**
- The Context is the class that maintains a reference to the selected strategy.
- It has a method to execute the algorithm, delegating the work to the strategy.
- The context does not know the details of the concrete strategy implementations.

**Strategy:**
- The Strategy interface declares the common method(s) for the algorithm.
- It serves as a contract for all concrete strategy implementations.
- Concrete strategies implement this interface to provide specific algorithmic implementations.

**Concrete Strategies:**
- Concrete Strategy classes implement the Strategy interface.
- Each concrete strategy provides a unique algorithmic implementation.
- Clients can choose and switch between different concrete strategies at runtime.

### Usage:

**Client Code:**
- The client creates a context object and initializes it with a specific strategy.
- The client interacts with the context, invoking the algorithm without being aware of the concrete strategy details.
- The client can dynamically change the strategy at runtime.

### When to Use the Strategy Pattern:

- When you have multiple algorithms for a specific task, and you want to make them interchangeable.
- When you want to allow clients to choose algorithms at runtime.
- When you want to isolate the algorithm implementation details from the client.

### Benefits:

- Enables the selection of algorithms at runtime.
- Promotes code flexibility and extensibility.
- Facilitates the addition of new algorithms without modifying existing client code.
- Encourages the use of composition over inheritance.

### Considerations:

- Clients need to be aware of the various strategies available.
- The pattern might lead to increased class count due to separate strategy implementations.

The Strategy pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to provide multiple ways to accomplish a task and let the client choose the most suitable strategy based on the context or requirements.
